1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I spent around 8 hours on the coding test. If I had more time, I would refine a few aspects to make the solution even better.

First, I'd focus on performance optimization, ensuring the code runs efficiently without unnecessary re-renders or API calls.

From a user experience perspective, I’d work on smoother animations and transitions, especially for mobile interactions, to eliminate any jerky behavior.

2. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

Yes, I have debugged and optimized performance issues in production before. My approach generally includes:

1. **Identify the Bottleneck:**
   - Use browser DevTools (Lighthouse, Network tab, Performance tab) to inspect slow-loading pages.
   
2. **Frontend Optimization:**
   - Reduce **render-blocking resources** (CSS & JS).
   - Implement **lazy loading** for images and components.
   - Optimize **JavaScript execution** and minimize re-renders in React.
